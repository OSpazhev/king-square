# King-square

This is my course project. I've used JavaFx as a main framework.
It's the game named in Ukrainian ["Королівський квадрат" (Also known as "Балда")](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%B0_(%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0))
To start this you just should execute jar/King-Square_jar.jar
